Finds generic name for any brand name medication using openFDA API

* This has been an idea of mine since freshmen year.
* Many generic medications are far less than their brand name counter parts. 
* This makes it easier for people to adhere to medication and have access to medication. 
* Using FDA data and information, the goal is to provide the generic names for any brand name medication. 
* Below is an example for Advil
